Click \"Accept\" for each one and they shouldn't appear again during this lesson. MacOS is trying to verify if these executables have been properly signed. Ray uses Redis. If you installed Python using Anaconda or other mechanism, then it probably isn't properly signed from the point of view of MacOS.
